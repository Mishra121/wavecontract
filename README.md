# Basic Smart Contract

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. Include a smart contract to store waves by users and also deployed on rinkbey test network.

Some of hardhat command for running locally:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js

As general rule, you can target any network configured in the hardhat.config.js

npx hardhat run --network <your-network> scripts/deploy.js
```
